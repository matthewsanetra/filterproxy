# filterproxy
A fast in-browser proxy that can replace any expression/key words from HTML.

I initially won't be working on adding CSS & JS support, but once I am able to modify links from HTML source it will be trivial


### TODO
- [ ] Nginx/caddy (Only passthrough /proxy)
- [ ] Make an index site
- [ ] Allow users to enter their own word that censored items get replaced with
- [ ] Replace urls in the html with a proxy url
